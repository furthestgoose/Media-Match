# Media Match
media match is an ios app I am creating, currently oauth2 has been implemented, users can add a profile picture and username as well as delete their account.Friend system has now been added, users can request, add and delete each from their friend lists.Users are now able to match movies with each other, browse movies and use filters on that browse section.Tv shows have been added and the match screen has been redesigned. To-do: add more info to match cards, rework home screen, handle poor/no network connection use case, fix bug with descriptions not expanding, add dark mode toggle to settings.
